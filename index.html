      <p class="p1">Hi! My name is Sehr Ali Lohsar and I'm 18 years old. I am currently a student at Jönköpings University and am studying Graphic Design and Web-development. Throughout my life I've travelled and lived in many different countries and contenents, ranging from America, Asia and Europe. I'm rich in culture as I come from a Pakistani/Norwegian household, and I cherish my friends and family that surround me most in my life. Baking is my biggest passion in life, and in the future I hope to pursue it and open my own bakery :D</p>
